A lot has changed during the four years I worked in Korean web agencies. Daum cafe users migrated to Freechal, while Netian collapsed; Freechal, in turn, was quickly overthrown by Cyworld. Naver Blog, with its mascot who tells you what you could write about today, was increasing market share; meanwhile, online banking became popular, WIPI was declared as standard wireless internet protocol, and grounds were laid for authentication certificates and ActiveX. The internet in Korea was moving from a collection of individual creators to a network of individuals belonging to corporate organizations; accordingly, the production and distribution of information was also shifting from individuals and news organizations to web portals. I was working on web design amidst this large shift.
</p>
<p>
My first job as web designer was in 2000, when I turned 20, at a small design company. We were one CEO, two directors of planning, one head of design team, one designer (me), one temp developer, and one accounting clerk working in an office around Seoul Nat'l Univ. of Education Station. Having witnessed the rapid growth of first-generation web agencies like Hongik Internet, the so-called second-generation web agencies were trying to gain a foothold in the emerging field. This was a time when big corporations were in need of well-made websites as part of their adaptation to the internet environment; at the same time, these corporations were experimenting with new business models that made active use of the internet. The newborn megaplex theaters were eager to make online reservations available; the still young mobile communication companies wanted online payment as well, along with the ability to manage plans and services on the internet. Banks were introducing online banking; terms like B2B, SI and ERP were easy to spot on newspapers. 
</p>
<p>
There was plenty of discussions about the new possibilities brought about by the internet, all across the society. Computer sections in bookstores carried books along the line of How to Become a Webmaster; newspapers and TV were defining the digital world as a future with connected internet, mobile phones and refrigerators. Web designers were pouring out of institutions that ranged from Green Computer Art School, the private institute with branches all across Seoul known for its aggressive telemarketing, to design departments within four-year universities. Web designers were everywhere; we used to joke about how each time shoulders are bumping in Teheranno, the IT street in Gangnam-gu, there was a web designer involved.

I don’t clearly remember my first encounter with the internet, possibly because I was not into dial-up BBS services as much as the other kids. This was partly because I was more into drawing back then; however, it seems the main reason was because my older sister, a high school student, was an active member of Nownuri. At some point, the only computer in our house took on the sole purpose of being the object my sister uses to connect to Nownuri; my turn with the computer were substantially rarer. After she went to college and became busy with other things than connecting to a BBS, the computer’s ownership returned mainly to me. My sister taught me how to connect to the internet, using Nownuri as gateway. I used Serome Dataman Pro to connect to Nownuri, and then proceeded to the internet environment that was connected through Netscape Communicator 4, in order to explore the many directories of Yahoo!; this was funny and everything, but it did not strike me as a meaningful activity—moreover, it was extremely slow.

A few years passed and in 1998 I was admitted in a design department of a four-year university. At some point, my desk started always having a computer on it. While its main purpose was Starcraft and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six, its necessity for school assignments was increasing. Sure, when I first started my studies, students used to submit handwritten papers; in Basics of Forms, a required first-year foundation course, the only person to have used a computer for their assignment was me. However, people’s life rapidly became dependent on computer tools like HWP, Word, Photoshop and Illustrator. My friends and I used to drunkenly debate over which Epson inkjet printer was the best model, what is the best size for a Wacom tablet, whether Matrox G300 was a better graphics card or Voodoo 3 was, and so on. I was making the same type of drawings I made in high school, but instead of my hands I was using Adobe Illustrator. 
</p>

<p>
I had moved past Nownuri and was using Netsgo that had 01442 as dial number. Netsgo, owned by SK Telecom, provided a dedicated connection software, Netsgo Browser; in a time when the internet was surpassing BBS services in terms of popularity, Netsgo Browser provided a relatively comfortable connection process to both the internet and the BBS service. The browser’s theme was customizable; the company even held a design contest in 2000.

My older cousin who lives in Gwangju visited us around this time. He showed me his personal website that he himself created. This was the first moment when my surrounding world and the internet had conjoined. My cousin’s website consisted of a short profile, some photos from his trip to the sea, and a guestbook; glittering “NEW” badges and a rotating 3d-rendered envelopes floated next to new articles and email links. This was the typical personal website that engineering students used to make. It occurred to me that if my cousin, with whom I wasted so many summer days, could make a website—then I could too. That night, I was poking around Microsoft FrontPage, which I had because it was probably bundled with my OS. A few days later I had moved on to Namo Web Editor; a few more days later, I got my hands on Dreamweaver; it was not long before I opened my eyes to the world of Flash, like many other designers did.
</p>

<p>
My first personal website—the first that was published on the web—was a full-on Flash web page. Captivated by Flash’s, well, flashiness, that enabled vector animations in a web browser, I had been wanting to build something in Flash myself. Back then, the hot topic around Flash animation was definitely the German design studio EYE4U’s website, designed in 1998. This website was essentially a clear materialization of Flash’s vision, or Macromedia’s vision, of the future of the web. Graphic elements that are not distorted when one zooms in, interactivity, smooth animations and exactly synced sounds—the website’s fullscreen animation completely destroyed the conventional thinking that the web is for documents, and opened up a new horizon for web designers. EYE4U provided the turning point for websites around this period. Another project, MONO*crafts 2.0 by Yugo Nakamura, was best at showing the potential of the interactivity provided by Flash. It was a demonstration of everything that early ActionScript could do, and it served as the archetype of Flash websites that made many Korean web agencies (such as Postvisual, d’strict, Vinyl) famous.

<p>Macromedia was dominating the market with Director, a publishing tool for interactive multimedia—which was almost synonymous with CD-ROM before the advent of the internet. Macromedia’s attempts to maintain that position in an internet-based interactive media environment were Flash and Dreamweaver. Flash was treated like Director’s cousin, suited for achieving similar results online; Dreamweaver was a WYSIWYG editor that helped designers create HTML documents without being too familiar with HTML syntax. The future internet envisioned by Macromedia in the early 2000s was quite different from what we are facing today; Macromedia was no longer even contributing to that future, after being acquired by Adobe in 2005. Flash stuck around for some time, especially in areas like advertisement, despite Adobe’s loose management and the resulting technical deficiencies like many security issues and memory leaks. However, it effectively lost its position in the market as Steve Jobs announced in 2010 that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aT4wt0fmGU">the iPhone would no longer support Flash</a>—and so Macromedia was forgotten as well.

My first project in 2000 was building Samsung Electronics’ Swedish website. For the new bewildered kid—me—dispatched to the Samsung Electronics headquarter building near City Hall, this project had an enormity beyond perceptions. It was a very small part of a much bigger project that consisted of unifying the visual identity and data structure of international Samsung Electronics websites, which probably must have been sporadic instances of product and service showcase pages. Whatever understanding I had about the scale of the project came from a giant sitemap that hung on a wall of the office. Roughly over 10 meters wide, the sitemap neatly displayed data hierarchies across each country’s website, front-end and back-end, how the content of each website connects to the intranet resource management system, and so on. I later found out that this isometric sitemap was characteristic of Providence-based digital information design consultancy Dynamic Diagrams, which I could guess had set up the project’s main structure. 
</p>

<p class="expand">

</p>

<p>
The web development project in question consisted of a planning team in charge of creating and organizing the content, a design team in charge of creating the layouts, graphics and HTML documents that go in the website, and a development team in charge of server and data management. Samsung Electronics needed a local development company that could develop websites according to the greater structure laid out by Dynamic Diagrams, and probably was going through each country’s website based on the country’s priority. The Swedish and British websites were undertaken by a much larger and more experienced company than mine. This development company in turn subcontracted my company for the design of the Swedish website only; my company sent out myself and one of the directors of planning. I gained an overall understanding of what goes into a website development project. I also learned how many web designers there are in the world, how hard it is to communicate with a developer, and how fortunate it is to meet a competent planner/project manager.
</p>

<p>
Another thing I experienced was the daily routine of working for a big company. In the morning, people with the same access cards on their neck walked in rows into the same building; in the evening, those same people scattered into subway stations and bus stops. These people all came out simultaneously for lunch as well. This is why nearby restaurants had tables set up and ready even before noon, so that the customer could eat as fast as possible. Some restaurants, in order to achieve maximum turnover, prepared tables according to the average ratio of ordered menus; the patrons would be sorted and seated based on their menu choice. On the way back from lunch, people working for hostess clubs nearby gave out business cards slipped inside sports newspapers. Employees gathered in small groups behind the building, reading or gossiping about celebrities and sports while smoking cigarettes.
</p>

<p>
I worked as a Skilled Industry Personnel (SIP) from 2001 till 2004. This means that I substituted my military duties with my work in a business designated by the Military Manpower Administration (MMA). In order for a drafted person classified as Active Duty in their physical exam to apply for alternative service, one needed to acquire an Industrial Engineer Information Processing certificate or higher. After getting the certificate, the applicant has to find a so-called “T/O,” a Korean-specific term for vacancy in a table of organization, allocated yearly by the MMA to the business. My first company was designated as substitutional military service provider and was allotted one T/O vacancy right after I started working, but it decided that hiring a developer (and not me) was a better move for business. Next year, after my company acquired another spot, I could finally start working as an SIP; the next year, I moved on to another company, where I stayed until my duties were over. 
</p>

<p>
Working as an SIP was to be in an uncertain position. I hadn’t graduated but was already working. I was in military service but living as a civilian. I was learning to design as a student in my school, but outside I was working as a professional—since the company was small, my position was Design Team Leader. For such reasons, returning to school after a few years of professional experience did not seem so easy. I did not really need more vocational training; stepping away from a career I already initiated needed some courage. There were several of us SIPs, working as HTML coders and designers in web agencies. We used to compare how many days each one of us had before being discharged, using an application minimized in the Windows tray, named ‘Substitute Clock’—and that was probably created by an SIP. This application displayed my time left in service by the second. It had bar graphs with an elegant gradation, of which one could change each end’s color. One could add multiple users to the app in order to compare each other’s time left; however, it was not possible to delete users once they were added, so I kept looking at graphs filled with the many people who had already finished their duties.
</p>

<p>
Most medium- to big-sized web agencies were substitutional military service providers back then. This is probably because the younger workforce had better technological understanding and lower salary range. In many cases, the CEOs of those web agencies were born in the 70s and had graduated from related academic fields around 2000; they rode the dot-com frenzy and venture craze, founding companies right after or even before graduating. Becoming a substitutional military service provider was a way to hire designers younger than themselves in a relatively stable manner, for several years. Also, many CEOs(?) were female, at least on paper, since female owners/CEOs received priority when applying.
</p>

<p>
Traditional visual design fields, such as annual reports or CIs for big companies, were hard to penetrate due to established existing design companies with experience, portfolio and network. However, when it came to web development, companies run by renowned designers were at the same place as new student-run agencies. They participated equally in corporate project bids; young web agencies soon started to win big projects, thanks to the fact that they were quick to understand and react to the technology and the market. For example, the second web agency I worked at was founded in 2000 with 4 people; four years later, that number was over 150. In order to maintain such a scale, these agencies needed big-scale web projects—usually from big companies specializing in finance or mobile communication. Soon, the agencies—now mid-sized firms—themselves specialized in their own way, for example by becoming good at building financial websites or by proposing creative advertisement campaigns that went beyond just websites. 
</p>

<p>
I worked at this second company for two years, from 2002 till 2004. A lot of people joined and then left while I was working. I only had finished my sophomore year before joining the service; I was one of the youngest employees. Unlike me, whose main goal was to complete the military duties, it seems that my colleagues had a strong self-perception as professionals, and therefore they were very serious in their career as designers. Some of them were permanent employees, and some were project-based temps. Among the temps were the so-called specialists, who were allegedly paid much more than regular employees. The specialists handled the most crucial problems in a 3- to 6-month web development project, whether the problems were design, Flash development or communication with the client. Companies always needed people who could take on such roles, whether they were permanents or temps; these people busily worked on project after project.
</p>

<p>
It was common for designers, including my colleagues and the people working for competing companies, to have their personal website. To a young designer who builds websites for a living, a personal website was at the same time a useful portfolio of one’s capacity and a tool for a loose network-building. These websites all looked very different, but the underlying technology was pretty much the same: Zeroboard with some custom HTML. Of course, some people put incredible amounts of effort into building an elaborate Flash home page, and others included drawing boards called Oekaki; however, most websites’ structure consisted of a bulletin board, a guestbook and bookmark links. Web designers visited other designers’ websites, greeted each other in guestbooks, shared how they had made something, and peeped at strangers’ websites.
</p>

<p>
Designers equipped with Zeroboard and a little bit of Flash skills had the chance to take on side jobs. The World Wide Web had become popular enough that even small companies had the desire to have their own website. However, it was expensive to hire mid-sized web agencies that usually worked with big corporations. On the other hand, small web agencies came down to just one or two designers, in many cases. So it was common to hire an individual designer for “turnkey” web development, rather than agencies. As a result, these websites were technically very similar to the designers’ personal websites. Most features that small companies needed were achievable by making small modifications to Zeroboard; some companies, realizing that Flash was the cutting-edge web technology, wanted their product to move around flashily on their home page. This meant that any web designer capable of some level of HTML coding, Flash development and Zeroboard customization was able to plan, design and develop a website from scratch. And indeed, these types of websites were built and built. Individual web designers applied their skills, learned by building their own personal websites, to building standard Korean small- to mid-sized business websites, with a Flash home page and Zeroboard; many of them can still be found as of now.
</p>

<p>
In 2004, one of the bigger companies in the field went bankrupt. This company was known for exploring new business models, including overseas project and outsourcing basic development tasks to Southeast Asia, where developers were cheaper. It also famously won <a href="http://m.zdnet.co.kr/news_view.asp?article_id=00000010048285">a massive project for the e-government system of an Indonesian regional government</a>. Unconfirmed rumors have it that the direct cause of the bankruptcy was the late payment from this project. Anyway, the company disappeared and a large number of designers were thrown into the market. Some of them joined our company and some joined our competitors; others went to web portals, which were aggressively hiring designers at the time. Web portals were a great prospect to my colleagues, since those meant doing the same type of job but having access to large-firm level welfare. Many of them actually left or considered leaving web agencies to join major web portals; it was a regular topic of our talks over drinks.
</p>

<p>
It was around this time that I myself left my web agency. One reason was that my military duties were over, but another was that I wanted to continue my studies. Some of my SIP friends decided to stay at their companies and start an actual career; some of them went back to school like I did. Many colleagues slowly moved over to web portals and some launched their own studios, while others stopped working in design altogether. The web in 2016 is very different from that of 2000, but I can’t help looking at it with the perspective shaped by my experience in web agencies in the early 2000s. When I look at a Korean text rendered as image, I think of the designer who had to create, name and export the file. I also imagine the numerous Powerpoint proposals and requested modifications, lying hidden behind websites. I wonder what is the big current of change these designers are immersed in.
