  As I finished my military duties in January 2011, I was feeling confident that I would be able to achieve something from now on. During my service, I had chosen to compensate the loss of my personal freedom and dreams and hope by sleeping two hours less each day. Those two hours were used to read quite utopian texts; I didn’t understand many of them, but I still shoved them into my brain thinking that I was preparing for the day of my discharge.
</p>

<p>
  It was indeed fortunate that I did not spend my extra energy into more entertaining activities. I decided to spend my hopeful energy into building a new service along with Y, a friend I met in the army. Y was an intelligent filmmaker, and with him I could have discussions much deeper than I expected I could have in the army. He and I often shared articles that we printed in the cyber intelligence and information room or other books; one book I recommended him was Lawrence Lessig’s REMIX. I was also inspired by the individual donation model, and was experimenting with small project plans. Seeing this, Y talked to me about his interest about a funding model for creative projects that was successful in the U.S. and suggested that we make <a href="https://tumblbug.com" target="_blank">a service where people making creative projects, like films, could propose their vision and receive monetary feedback</a>.
</p>

<p>
  That was the beginning. At that time, <a href="http://kickstarter.com" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> was a new crowdfunding platform, not even one year old; however, the successful $200K funding of Diaspora, a distributed social network service, was a big issue. In our opinion, Kickstarter’s success was mainly due to its funding process that reduced risks both for the creators and backers. The creator’s public proposal was also a test for how realistic the project was, and once the funding was successful one could afford the stability to focus on executing the project. This is what we decided to do with our precious post-military vigor; we decided to build a crowdfunding platform that disperses creators’ financial risks.
</p>
<p>
  One of the first things that Y did as co-founder was attempting to register our company by himself rather than hiring an attorney. The problem was that prior to that, we bought ourselves celebratory Macbook Pro’s. There just was no way for someone to fill out the Supreme Court Registry Office’s forms and print them on Mac OS. Instead of buying an additional Windows device, we thought we could work around this problem by installing Parallels Desktop and running a virtual Windows machine on one of our Mac machines. Alas, the Registry Office refused to acknowledge our virtual machine as a valid OS; we had to admit after a long and painful lesson that we did actually need a Windows machine. At least we thought that was the end of the lesson. It was not. Apparently our printer was not supported by the Registry Office’s online system. What, now we need printers with security authentication enabled? Not at all; what we needed was a model supported by the ActiveX security module, since these modules only support specific printers. This very specific need was acknowledged by <a href="http://danawa.com" target="_blank">danawa.com</a>, a tech-focused comparison shopping website, which provided filters for printers supported by e-government systems. At last, we could finish registering our business.
</p>

<p>
  During our planning process, we narrowed our focus on how to implement project funding functionalities and started researching. We found out that when Kickstarter started out in 2009, they relied on Amazon Web Service’s Flexible Payment Service<a id="rfn-1" href="#fn-1" class="sub">[1]</a> (FPS) in order to implement their All-or-nothing (backers’ money is withdrawn only when the project is successfully funded) model. Compared to Korean payment gateway services that provided payment modules to affiliate members, FPS had clear advantages; it was as if the affiliate member had its own small payment gateway agency. Because users’ transaction information was stored by Amazon, the All-or-nothing process made sense. As the actual payment only occurs in case of successful funding, and no action is required for the user in case of failed funding, it was possible to run a very smooth service. If, on the contrary, actual payment occurred amidst the backing period, the exhausting procedures of refunding money to backers of failed projects will be a constant and painful part of the business. Therefore, this payment system was the technical scaffold that enabled Kickstarter’s business model. In addition, it was possible to automatically split the final amount into the project owner’s and Kickstarter’s accounts, as if Kickstarter was running its own payment gateway. These detailed controls over the payment process seemed impossible without an infrastructure design that understands what kind of environment makers are in.
</p>
<p>
  After researching Kickstarter, we brought our attention back to the Korean web. Awaiting us was a near-infinite supply of frustration. What we needed to build was a system that does not rely on ActiveX, can both store credit card information and execute transactions when a project is successful, and transfer that money separately to the project owner’s and the platform’s accounts. Was this possible? In 2011, the state of online payment within and outside Korea was much more disparate than it is now. Amazon patented the one-click technique (payment information is stored from previous transactions, allowing the purchase to be made in a single click) in 2000 and had been providing similar payment experience for a decade. Apple’s App Store, Uber and Paypal are all services that rely on this type of payment experience, where payment information is securely stored and the user can make purchases through simpler authentication processes. Meanwhile, in South Korea, one of the most difficult things one can do is to buy stuff on the internet. Show me any Windows machine and I will show you ActiveX modules no one knows what they do, along with additional modules that manage the previous modules. Because the essential activities of banking, shopping and administrative tasks are impossible without ActiveX modules, it was also nearly impossible to be a Mac OS-only user. In order to avoid their computers to be ‘polluted,’ some Mac users bought ‘zombie PCs’—Windows machines only used for online shopping and banking transactions.

<p>
  On the one hand, we needed some sort of innovative form of online payment system; on the other, we were barely a company—perhaps closer to two individual makers, with neither law nor money on our side. What we could do was ask payment infrastructure companies about the possibility of ActiveX-less payment modules, and dig deeper into the technicalities of laws in order to see whether the use of ActiveX was really mandatory. First, we checked if any payment gateway service offered a delayed payment model. Our first pick was Inicis, the oldest payment gateway service in Korea that started out as Dacom’s in-house venture. One of Inicis’ main strategy was to define 3-D Secure, the widely used security protocol promoted by Visa, as a threat to local technology; instead, it developed Internet Secure Payment (ISP) in collaboration with BC Card. 3-D Secure has been implemented in the Korean market as Ansim Click, an ActiveX module. When we visited Inicis, the company was promoting a cross-browser payment service, supporting the namely Open Web. However, one could only use cards from a few companies including Shinhan and Samsung; also, we were told that storage of credit card information was not possible due to the card companies’ opposition.
</p>
<p>
  Other companies similar to Inicis, including LG Uplus, KG Mobilians and Allat, also offered similar ActiveX-based solutions and their risk management teams gave us similar answers. In fact, they all gave us the same answer: no company was willing to support a new start-up’s peculiar payment method. Even if they were willing to, what they offer would have been an ActiveX-based solution, which we would have refused right away. The reason we were obsessed with not having ActiveX was because otherwise we were sure we would lose a large number of our target audience, mostly Mac-using creatives, during the payment process. For us platform designers, this was not trivial. This is not even about us; any web service-based company faces the fatal task of designing a simple payment process. Considering the changes in media landscape such as the expansion towards mobile, providing the end user with a natural process that helps both the users in achieving their goals and the company make profit is the top question web service-based companies have to deal with. 
</p>
<p>
  Through further research, we could find two exceptions to the seemingly universal ActiveX usage. One was, surprisingly, Naver Music’s monthly fee payment. The aggressive pop-up windows or alerts that state something along the line of “This Netscape browser is not supported” did not appear; the service just accepted by credit card number and expiration date, authenticated the payment, and continued to withdraw monthly fees without any further actions from my side. I was amazed, and I tried to find out which payment gateway was behind the streaming service. What I found out was that Naver Music was essentially Mnet’s audio streaming system, only rented out under a different name; the payment was handled by CJ Networks, which also handled the payment for other companies owned by CJ. Now that I think of it, it makes sense that payment gateway companies did not even care about the idea of ActiveX-less payment solutions. I also suspect that big companies like CJ could afford to create their own payment gateway agency, which requires a capital of KRW 5B, and leverage it to persuade credit card companies into accepting ActiveX-less payment solutions.
</p>
<p>
  Back then I was not thinking of all this. However, we did find out about another company, Paygate. Compared to Inicis, Paygate had a rather inferior-looking website and a payment user interface (UI) that I had never seen before in any online shops; at first, I did not know whether I should trust this company at all. This changed when we tried out a purchase; some credit cards, including Shinhan and KB, could actually be used without ActiveX. The UI was not pretty, but we did not care—we thought we could customize it later, which by the way did not work out well. Also, the website that was using this unattractive UI gave us a sort of enlightenment; it was the Korean page of Apple Store.

  Never did I have a stronger empathy towards Apple Korea Ltd. They must have introduced Paygate’s payment system with the single goal of achieving an ActiveX-less payment environment. Apple owns Mac OS, whereas Korean payment solutions are Windows-based; their level of desperation must have been much higher than ours. The Korean Apple Store had compromised the then-trademark skeuomorphic design, but the silent promotion of its ActiveX-less payment system was paying off. Paygate had one ugly UI, but the company was promoting that it fulfilled the international security standard PCI DSS’s requirements. In fact, the company had quite a long history—it was founded in 1998.
</p>
<p>
  We wondered why this company had invested itself in “ActiveX-less” and dug into interviews and articles. Their comments on how the ActiveX technology has been causing inconvenience and impose social costs on individual online shops, effectively shifting security-related responsibility from service providers to affiliate members and customers, were spot on; their continuous effort on the fundamentals of online transactions—preventing transaction failures—was inspiring. Apparently, we were not the only ones who were inspired. The online bookstore Aladin also introduced a non-ActiveX payment option by implementing Paygate’s payment module. Aladin is among companies that have continuously put efforts toward smooth, non-ActiveX payment environment. However, since the use of card numbers and expiration dates was not enough to assure security, an additional measure was added; Amount Authentication (AA) involves a small random amount withdrawn from the user’s account, which is then used to verify that the user indeed owns the account.

  Of course, ActiveX is not needed in order to implement this; in 2012, the Financial Supervisory Service approved this service, which then was launched by Aladin and gained public appraise. Dreamwiz President Chan Jin Lee, famously an early adopter and Apple user, wrote a tweet after using Aladin’s new payment system, while provoking Hyundai Card CEO Tae Young Chung for not supporting such a system.

Chung’s reaction was that Aladin’s method was not government-approved, which caused a turmoil in the tweetosphere over whether Aladin’s service was legal; Hyundai Card issued an official statement; other card companies, fearing potential trouble from the non-orthodox payment system, decided to end their contracts with Aladin. Within two months of the new system’s introduction, all 8 member companies of the Credit Finance Association ended their contract with Aladin, which was in turn forced to reintroduce ActiveX-based payment solutions. One can feel anger from Sung Dong Kim’s interview, then Marketing Team Leader of Aladin; their attempt turned into dust, leaving only a message behind. The interview criticizes the problems of the Korean online payment market and its fixation over ActiveX, along with more structural problems of the Korean society in general. Additional CS costs that burdens individual online shops; shifting the responsibility for security breaches; complicated online payment interfaces that are inaccessible even to computer literates; executives unable to see big pictures; a computing environment standardized around outdated versions of Internet Explorer; inability to communicate with card companies; dual principles depending on businesses; a corporate culture made of up-down communication and blame shifting; a shallow understanding of security; innovations forced from the top; unfair and unilateral contract cancellations; political ideologies used as leverage over businesses; etc.

All this happened three years ago; after parting my platform service, I arrived in the U.S. in 2015. I ran into quite a lot of troubles trying to make things. Once my API keys for Amazon Web Services were used by hackers to mine Bitcoins, which in turn resulted in nearly $1K being charged to my credit card; however, after I filed a complaint, Amazon reimbursed the money right away. My friend’s card theft that involved $800 was also reimbursed. I think Fintech startups need this type of security nets. Looking at the Korean internet in 2016, it seems that Paygate’s dream of simpler payment is becoming reality. Naver Shopping implemented their own payment system, which accounts for 20% of total transactions. Some fintech startups like Toss<a href="#fn-2" id="rfn-2" class="sub">[2]</a> are engaging in cash transfer, and actually gathering more and more affiliate banks; when I think of the struggles I had to go through, this all is just surprising. 
</p>
<p>
The amendment to the Electronic Financial Transactions Act passed in October 2014, removing the previous legal grounds for mandatory use of ActiveX; The Regulation on Supervision of Electronic Financial Activities was also accordingly amended in 2015. However, was there a significant improvement?<a href="#fn-3" id="rfn-3" class="sub">[3]</a> The president’s comment on Chinese customers having trouble with online purchasing from Korean websites did trigger some changes, but some companies are just wrapping previous ActiveX modules in .exe files. Dongoh Park’s article provides a perspective on the structural persistence of ActiveX. Park points us to the socio-technological system dominated by ActiveX and ActiveX-based authentication certificates, and the reversal phenomenon where familiarity to a certain infrastructure result in resistance towards the introduction of new technologies. 
</p>
<p style="display: none;">
“…현 공인인증서와 유사한 수준의 인터페이스와 사용성을 갖춘 기술이 웹표준으로 설정되어 브라우저에 탑재되길 기대하기는 어렵다. 공인인증체계를 포기하고 은행이나 공공기관마다 독자적 인증체계를 갖추도록 한다면, ‘하나의 인증서를 가지면 거의 모든 전자상거래 및 전자정부 서비스를 이용’하는 것과 같이 높은 사용성을 기대하기는 어렵다. 우리는 이 인프라스트럭쳐에 어느 정도 길들여졌고 거꾸로 이는 우리의 선택권을 제한한다.”
</p>
<p>
Law, the enforcing element of the ActiveX infrastructure, has been amended. However, the social system and culture that the Korean society has built for the past two decades still exist: banks’ prior investment on security solutions, consumer service costs, businesses built around ActiveX software and their employees, the learning and emotional costs involved in a new online banking and shopping environment, authentication certificate organizations that are losing the profits form certificate fees, and uninformed decision makers that order Korean versions of Pokemon GO. Could an external shock cause a hard reset on the market, like the iPhone did? Or will someone develop an acceptable local solution, if we bear with a little more absurdities like the i-PIN graphic authentication?
</p>
<p>
Everyone has dreams and hopes. For me, the internet used to offer a relatively realistic path towards those dreams and hopes. However, ActiveX was enough to make me understand what the actual reality was; that different entities envision different dreams and hopes, from government to big companies to small companies; and that in this country, one might strive to find challenges and alternatives, but one’s dreams and hopes can still be attacked by ActiveX, or its other forms like .exe.
